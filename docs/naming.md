# Naming rules

In general, use camelCase for a majority of things. Including method and function names, `index.*` files names, variable names, etc.

Use PascalCase for ES6 classes names including React component names even if it's a function component.

## File name

All source code files must have one of the following extensions:

- `.d.ts` - for files with type definitions only.
- `.ts` - for files with regular TS source code.
- `.tsx` - for files with JSX code.
- `.css` - for files with css.
- `.md` - for docs.
